BackerTester

BackerTester is a simple backtesting tool where you provide a trading strategy and a symbol (e.g., a stock or crypto ticker). It returns the win/loss ratio over a specified timeframe.

Additional metrics such as variance, number of entries, and capital gain (based on a fixed starting capital) may also be included in future updates. Plotting capabilities are also planned.

The application fetches historical market data, calculates the delta between each data point, and determines entries and exits using take-profit and stop-loss levels based on your strategy.
